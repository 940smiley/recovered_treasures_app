# Release Evaluation

- No new release created. The repository has no existing tags or versioned releases to increment, and the new AI routing work is the first significant feature since initialization.
- Recommendation: cut `v0.2.1` after integrating automated CI (tests + lint) and validating the AI endpoints in a staging environment.
